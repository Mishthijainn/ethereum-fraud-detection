# 🚀 Ethereum Fraud Detection - Anomaly Detection Model

This project detects fraudulent Ethereum transactions using **machine learning anomaly detection techniques** such as **Isolation Forest**. It includes a **Streamlit web app** for user interaction and a **Jupyter Notebook** for model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 📌 Key Features:
- **Fraud Detection with Isolation Forest:** Identifies fraudulent Ethereum transactions based on transaction patterns.
- **Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuned **Isolation Forest** for better fraud detection accuracy.
- **t-SNE Visualizations:** Visualize fraud patterns using **t-SNE** for dimensionality reduction.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Built using **Streamlit** for real-time fraud detection and insights.
